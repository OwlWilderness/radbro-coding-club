# Welcome to Radbro Coding Club

This repository will serve as a place for all work / information / conversations that we want to track, preserve, and share long-term.

Since our main thread of communication will be via twitter gc, and we all will need Github accounts to follow some of the lessons / projects.

I figured we should just use Github itself to pin information & have long-running conversationd on coding topics. This way we can avoid use of discord and telegram entirely.

Long-running conversations on specific topics can be had using [issues](https://github.com/radbro/radbro-coding-club/issues/).

Lesson plans, guides, + links to additional materials will be posted here as well.
